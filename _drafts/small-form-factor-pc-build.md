I'm considering building a "Small Form Factor" PC build. After a long day of working at a desk, the last thing I want to do is go home to my desk to play games on. So I thought I'd build a PC so I could play games on my favorite place - the couch.

I know this is essentially an "overpriced" console, but I enjoy it, so leave me alone.

Here was my first stab at a build, with about as high end stuff as I could pick:

 I then started reading a bit about small-form factor builds, and thought I might be able to get away with something more built around the Thermaltake Core V21, with a GTX mini instead of a full size.

 I'm still very much is "design" mode now, while I'm saving up my budget to afford it.

 I'll post more as I progress and settle on a build.
