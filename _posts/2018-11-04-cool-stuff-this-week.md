This is all the cool stuff I found this week.

<!--more-->

* [cncf/landscape](https://l.cncf.io/) - Cloud Native Computing Foundation interactive landscape. A great resource for finding popular projects in the cloud space.
  * Also take a look at their [github repository](https://github.com/cncf/landscape). Their included cloud native trail map is a really cool resource for anyone looking to transition into cloud technologies.
* [microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts) - Microsoft provided dev box setup scripts. I strongly encourage anybody on a team to leverage something like this for boostrapping developers machines. Great for onboarding! I plan on using this heavily for reference next time I need to build a dev PC.
* [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) - This tool got mentioned to me by an engineer at work. Quickly change between contexts and namespaces. This will be a keystroke saver for those constantly switching between kubernetes contexts.
