This is all the cool stuff I found this week.

* [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) - After listening to the interview on [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) podcast, episode [#306](https://changelog.com/podcast/306), it has my interest piqued. I might try it out for some personal projects.
* A couple of maven plugins I'm exploring to improve my personal workflow:
  * [dockerfile-maven](https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven) - From spotify, can be used to set up targets to build/deploy docker containers from Dockerfiles in your modules.
  * [fabric8-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-maven-plugin) - Seems a little more "full-featured" than dockerfile-maven. I have yet to fully dig in on this one.
* [commandline](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline) parser - A commandline parser for .NET.
