My name is Isaac Broyles. I started my professional career in software engineering in 2011 after graduating from University of Texas at Dallas. After working for several years as a Software Engineer, I became Software Architect for Armor Defense, Inc, a prominent cloud security company. After helping the company build the next generation secure IaaS product, I moved on to work for Toyota Connected in 2018 where I currently work as a Senior Engineer. The thoughts and opinions expressed on this site are my own.
