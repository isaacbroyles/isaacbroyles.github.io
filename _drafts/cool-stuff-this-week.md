This is all the cool stuff I found this week. Bear with me as I am reintroducing myself to Java at the moment, so some of the things mentioned here may be common knowledge.

* [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) - Obviously, this thing has been around for a while. I fully understand I'm late to the party on this one. Ironically enough, I was introduced to this while listening to a .NET podcast [(.NET Rocks #1556)](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1556) about [Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly). I've used Polly in the past, but not Hystrix... yet.
* [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) - Planning to start using this on my website to auto-generate a compliant sitemap.
* [hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) - The theme I'm now using for this site.
