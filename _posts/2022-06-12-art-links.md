## Books

* [Figure Drawing for All It's Worth - Andrew Loomis](https://amzn.to/3xH5d72){:target="\_blank"} - This has been my primary study material for figure drawing. I worked through this book page by page, redrawing many of the poses in here as per Loomis' method. I feel like my figure drawing improved significantly after going through this book.

* [Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](https://amzn.to/3zzeiA1){:target="\_blank"} - I have mixed feelings about this book, but I would still recommend it to very early beginners. It has some good lessons, but I personally felt like I needed to quickly move on from the lessons in this book.

I've used this list as a hub to find some of the best resources for the topics I want to study. Strongly recommend going through it.
